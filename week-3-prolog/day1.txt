// Prolog, declarative logical language

Like SQL, Prolog has two parts: one to express the data and one to query the data.
In Prolog, the data is in the form of logical rules.
These are the building blocks:
- Facts. A fact is a basic assertion about some world. (Babe is a pig; pigs like mud.)
- Rules. A rule is an inference about the facts in that world. (An animal likes mud if it is a pig.)
- Query. A query is a question about that world. (Does Babe like mud?)

# Haskell
Haskell is a static, strong typed functional language.

## Basic Commands

### Strings
Strings are list of characters. They can be concatenated with the ++ operator.

```haskell
-- string
"ab" -- "ab"

-- list of characters
['a', 'b'] -- "ab"

-- string concatenation
"hello" ++ " world"
```

### Booleans
Booleans are like the other ***infix*** languages.

```haskell
-- equal
(4 + 5) == 9 -- true

-- non equal
(5 + 5) /= 10 -- false
(5 + 5) /= 9 -- true
```

Haskell is guessing if there is a follow-up line on what we type, so in an ***if*** block both then and else has to be present.

```haskell
-- incorrect block
if (5 == 5) then "true" -- parse error (possibly incorrect indentation or mismatched brackets)

-- correct block
if (5 == 5) then "true" else "false"
```

Is worth noting that ***if*** is a function and not a control structure, so it is returning a value.

### Type system
Haskell will try to infer the type of the variables, so the compiler won't show the type of a value if not forced to do it with the flat ***:t***.

```haskell
4 -- 4
:t 4 -- 4 :: Num a => a
```

### Let
Let is used to bind a variable to a value. You can also bind functions to variables.

```haskell
-- bind the variable
let x = 10

-- get the value of the variable
x -- 10

--- bind a function
let double x = x * 2

-- execute
double 2 -- 4
```

## Functions
Functions are the foundations of the programming paradigm of Haskell. We specify functions is two parts: an optional type specification and an implementation.

We define a function in a separate file, ***double.hs*** and load it into the console. The file defines a ***module*** that is a way in Haskell to collect related code into similar scope.

```haskell
-- load the module
load day01/double.hs
-- [1 of 1] Compiling Main             ( day01/double.hs, interpreted )

-- execute the function
double 5 -- 10
```

In the file ***double.hs*** we only defined the implementation without the (optional) type: the following definition is the complete one.

```haskell
module Main where
    double :: Integer -> Integer
    double x = x + x
```

### Recursion
We now present some functions using recursion. The first is the factorial, it is using pattern matching.

```haskell
-- factorial definition
module Main where
  factorial :: Integer -> Integer
  factorial 0 = 1
  factorial x = x * factorial (x - 1)

-- execution
factorial 3 -- 6
```

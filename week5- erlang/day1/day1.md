<h1>Erlang</h1>
Erlang has been made for extreme reliability and concurrency. It doesn't use a threading approach, it relies instead on lightweight process, so no shared resources are involved.

<h4>Reliability</h4>
Erlang has minimal error handling, using an approach of let crash the application, making easy to monitor, kill and restart processes.

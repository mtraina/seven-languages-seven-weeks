<h1>Scala</h1>
It is a language that is between Java and a functional language like Haskell. It runs on the JVM and it has several similarities with Java.

The main difference with Java are the following:
* Type inference
* Functional concepts
* Immutable variables
* Advanced programming constructs (actors, collections with higher-order functions, first-class XML processing)

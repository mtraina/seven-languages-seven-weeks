<h1>Scala</h1>
Scala is a language that unifies the object oriented paradigm and the functional one. It is between Java and a functional language like Haskell. It runs on the JVM and it has several similarities with Java.

<h3>Differences with Java</h3>
The main difference with Java are the following:
* Type inference
* Functional concepts
* Immutable variables
* Advanced programming constructs (actors, collections with higher-order functions, first-class XML processing)

<h3>Functional languages</h3>
Characteristics of a functional language are:
* functional programs are made by functions
* a function always returns a value
* a function will return <u>always</u> the same output, given the same input
* functional programs avoid changing state or mutating data

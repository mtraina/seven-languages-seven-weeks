An actor change its own state and accesses other actors only through controlled queues.
Threads can change each other's state without restrictions.

// futures
A future is a result object that is immediately returned from an asyncronous message call.
The future become the result once the the result is available.
If you ask for the value of a future before it is available

futureResult := URL with("http://google.com/") @fetch

writeln("Do something immediately while fetch goes on in background...")
// ...

writeln("This will block until the result is available.")
// this line will execute immediately

writeln("fetched ", futureResult size, " bytes")
// this will block until the computation is complete
// and Io prints the value
